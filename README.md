Remainder: From greatest to least priority


    * Currently planned features

        * Core features:
        * 1. Display dynamic data to the user...: - Create a private chatroom/privately message other registered users
        * 2. Upload data from the client to the back-end...:  - Ability to register and create a unique user account
        * 3. Meaningfully search through server-side data...:  - Search if a user is registered, so you can create a chatroom with them

        * Unique features:
        * 1. Ability to create a group chat with multiple people
        * 2. Emoji popup menu to send emojis
        * 3. Change between 6 unique themes for the messaging page
        * 4. (Maybe) files/images upload
 
    * To-do list - updated as of 3/9:

        * Uploading files
        * Fix register page so it doesn't accept duplicates and takes you somewhere
        * Deploying
        * Take underline out of buttons
        * Checking if a user exists when creating a room
        * Themes
            * Make pop ups/dialog box/emoji box theme-able
            * Make outer edges of the page theme-able
            * https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/
        
    * Look into deploying
        * Real-time messages between users (rather than sending locally)
        * This needs to be done last

    * Sending media                 - Terry and Karim
        Idea: Create a div of a specific size that will contain a snapshot of what the media will look like
        Whether you send a youtube video or an image, It'll send a message of the same size snap shot
        (like a youtube thumbnail)
