Remainder: From greatest to least priority
 
    * LoginPage/Firebase/Routing
        * Update 2/28: Register page now posts user data onto
        a collection in mongoDB. We should update the login   
        page to authenticate users. The plan is have the search 
        bar search through the entire database, instead of a 
        "contacts" system.                                    

    * Sidebar functionality
        * We need the sidebar to actually work
        * sidebar go brrr
    
    * Look into deploying
        * Real-time messages between users (rather than sending locally)
        * This needs to be done last

    * Sending media                 - Terry and Karim
        * Backup: EMOJIS

    * General CSS                   - Roye, Greg, and Karim

    * Themes                        - Everyone does 1 theme
        * For Inspiration : https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/

    * Things to consider/low priority tasks: 
        * Private routing 
        * Animations with CSS (fading, etc.)
        * Profile management (deleting account, changing username, etc.)
        * Searching content          
        * Group messaging

    * Things not to consider:
        * tic-tac-toe
        * wet burritos
